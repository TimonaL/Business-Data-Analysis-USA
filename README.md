Business Analysis Project in USA Cities

Overview

This project aims to conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about various businesses located in cities across the United States. The dataset includes details such as the formatted address, ratings, user ratings totals, and types of businesses. Through visualizations, statistical analysis, and data exploration techniques, this project seeks to uncover insights into the distribution, correlations, and patterns within the dataset.

Data Description

The dataset consists of the following columns:
1.	formatted_address: The address of the business located in cities across the USA.
2.	rating: The rating of the business (on a scale from 1 to 5).
3.	user_ratings_total: The total number of user ratings for the business.
4.	types: The type/category of the business.

Project Goals

•	Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution, correlations, and patterns within the dataset.
•	Visualize the data using plots such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and bar plots to gain insights into the businesses, their ratings, and user ratings totals.
•	Analyze how ratings vary across different types of businesses.
•	Identify any trends or relationships that may exist in the data.
•	To document key findings and insights obtained from the analysis and provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and its implications.

Key Findings

•	The distribution of ratings is approximately normal, with most businesses having ratings between 3 and 5.
•	There is a positive correlation between ratings and user ratings totals, indicating a weak to moderate tendency for businesses with more user ratings to have higher average ratings.
•	Certain types of businesses tend to have higher average ratings compared to others. Further analysis is needed to understand the factors contributing to this variation.

Conclusion

The project, aims to uncover valuable insights into the landscape of businesses across USA cities. By leveraging exploratory data analysis techniques, it seeks to identify trends, patterns, and relationships within the dataset, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of the factors influencing business ratings and user engagement. The findings from this analysis could have potential applications in various domains, including business management, marketing strategies, and urban planning.

Future Work

•	Perform predictive modeling to forecast business ratings or user ratings totals based on other features in the dataset.
•	Conduct geospatial analysis to visualize the locations of businesses on a map and explore any spatial patterns in the ratings or user ratings totals.
•	Explore sentiment analysis techniques to understand the sentiment associated with different types of businesses, potentially using natural language processing to analyze customer reviews.
